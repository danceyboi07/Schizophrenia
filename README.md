This project aimed to create an "AI Assistant for Schizophrenia Diagnosis" called "NeuroTech." It utilized both a convolutional neural network for the analysis of brain fMRIs 
and natural language processing algorithm for the analysis of doctor's notes (including age, gender, general psychological analysis, and family history.) At a high performance, 
this project will help with early detection of schizophrenia, while also making schizophrenia diagnosis more accessible.
